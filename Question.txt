Task: Simple Student Record System

You are required to implement a simple Java system to maintain the student records of a training center, which currently runs three online courses: Java Programming, Object Oriented Design and Software Testing. Student who passes all three courses can receive a software programmer certificate from this training center. The tuition fees for each course is RM 1500 at the moment. The manager can update the tuition fee of each courses at any time.

Every student enrolled in this training center has an unique student ID such as “S123”. Their full names are recorded such as “Naim Ahmad”.
